 Reference state is the stable state of your website. When you have finished all the updates and required edits. You need to proceed to your wordpress dashboard, select " Manage Tracked Files" from your wordpress dashboard menu. When the page loads, click on "Load All Files" and the list of files will be loaded. Scroll to bottom and click on "Save reference state" button

= Deleting files =

 You can only delete a file when you are sure that the file is important to your worpress function or if the file was maliciously added to your wordpress directory. In this case you need to do further investigation. Check your "access log" for the time and date the file was created and probably block the IP of the intruder, change your hosting passwords and follow other security measures.
